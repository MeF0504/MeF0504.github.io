# CMB

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is background radiation coming from the era of the early universe.
It is evidence of the Big Bang theory.

The linear polarization of CMB informs us further about the universe.
The _E_-mode polarization could tell us about the optical depth.
The sub-degree-scale _B_-mode polarization can inform the sum of neutrino mass via gravitational lensing.
The degree-scale _B_-mode polarization can be used to test the theory of cosmological inflation.

## Half-Wave Plate

A half-wave plate (HWP) is an optical device that creates an optical path difference of half of the wavelength.
In the CMB experiments, birefringent materials (e.g. Sapphire) are used.
By observing a linear polarization signal with continuously rotating HWP, the signal is modulated by four times the HWP rotation frequency.

Moreover, we can search for the circular polarization signal by using the leakage between linear and circular polarization due to the frequency dependence of the HWP.
