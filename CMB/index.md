# CMB

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a background radiation coming from the era of the early universe.
This is evidence of the Big Bang theory.
Moreover, the polarization of CMB can be used to test the theory of cosmological inflation.

## Half-Wave Plate

A half-wave plate (HWP) is used as the modulator of the linear polarization signal.
