# CMB

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a background radiation coming from the era of the early universe.
This is evidence of the Big Bang theory.
Moreover, the polarization of CMB can be used to test the theory of cosmological inflation.

## Half-Wave Plate

A half-wave plate (HWP) is an optical device that creates an optical path difference of half of the wavelength.
In the CMB experiments, birefringent materials (e.g. Sapphire) are used.
By observing a linear polarization signal with continuously rotating HWP, the signal is modulated by four times the HWP rotation frequency.

Moreover, we can search for the circular polarization signal by using the leakage between linear and circular polarization due to the frequency dependence of the HWP.
